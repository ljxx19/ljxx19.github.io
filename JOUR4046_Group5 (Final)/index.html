				<h1>Booming Pet Economy in China: Young People Spend Money for A Sense of Healing</h1>
				<h3>By SHENG An, SIN Peng Chiu, LIU Jiaxuan, and TSANG Chi Ming</h3>

					Hui Lin ZHOU is a final year student at Hong Kong Baptist University who adopted an orange cat
						by accident in Wuhan one year ago .“The cat Baozi has somehow already become a necessary part of
						my family. I would not leave her even if I was offered one hundred thousand dollars,” Zhou said.

				<h3> No matter pet owners or some pet-free people, they yearn for “a life with both cats and dogs”.
					“萌寵”, which is a new term invented by Chinese netizens, means “lovely pets” literally. In
					contemporary society, pets not only are animals, but also serve as companions. Living a fast-paced
					and stressful life in the cities on their own, the millennials, called “Youth residing in empty
					nests”, are more than willing to keep a pet or just watch pet vlogs on social media to feel a sense
					of healing. Pet videos on social media could help to fill the emotional void for the audience,
					providing more business opportunities for pet e-commerce.
				</h3>
				<h3> The economic potential in the pet industry has never been so
					promising, attracting countless capital to this industry. The pet industry’s market size has reached
					100 billion RMB since 2016, and it keeps increasing in recent years with a year-to-year growth rate
					at around 15% on average.

					<h2>Pet E-Commerce Consumption: A Transformation to Satisfy Emotional Needs </h2>
					<h3>E-commerce is nowadays a popular channel for pets owners to purchase those high-end and imported
						pet food as well as other necessities including grooming and health care products, as some of
						them are no longer satisfied with purchasing basic pet food to meet pet’s physiological needs
						only. Bolstered by it, China’s pet industry has witnessed an aggressive growth.
					</h3>
					<h3>For Hui Lin ZHOU, before Baozi (her cat name) arrived, she had already spent around 2000RMB
						purchasing pet products including automatic feeder, cat fountain, nursing products and so on.
						She said, “Nowadays the products for cats are much more advanced and
						expensive than they used to be”.
					</h3>
					<h3>When choosing the food and drink, she was quite concerned about
						the nutrient component and the ingredient contained. After listening to suggestions from senior
						cat keepers and comparing several brands of cat food by herself, she decided to buy almost the
						most expensive one available from the market, the price of which is relatively high, at around
						520RMB per bag. In the past year, Zhou spent roughly 7500RMB on this cat.</h3>

					<h3>Like ZHOU, the 80s and 90s are the mainstream consumers and they have become a huge purchasing
						power. The per
						capita consumption for one single pet per year is gradually increasing. In 2018, the average
						consumption of
						a pet per person is 5016 RMB, which increased by 10.9% in 2019. The dog and cat owners’
						consumption
						increased by around 10%. They both reach 4000 RMB a year.

					<h3>Besides pet food, medical and health care account for a large proportion of the spending. Every
						month Zhou persists in taking Baozi to the clinic to expel worms and take vaccines. She also
						follows the veterinarian's instruction to buy some health supplements such as vitamin and joint
						formula and does the physical check-up once a year. Talking about the reasons behind it, Zhou
						said “One is to prevent Baozi from suffering from pain, and another is because once a cat got
						ill, the cost would be too high to afford.”
					</h3>
					<h2>“Although my spending can by no means be compared with those rich pet owners, it is still higher
						than most common people,” said Zhou.
					</h2>
					<h3>Measured by the income situation of pet owners in mainland China, low-income people have a
						higher proportion of pets keeping. According to the Guojin Securities Research Center, almost
						50% of pet owners have an income of 4000 RMB or below per month. Around 20% have more than
						10,000 RMB. At this moment, those high-income consumers are the main purchasing power in the pet
						industry.

				<h2>“Cyber Pet Petting”: An Alternative for Pet-Free People</h2>
				<h3>
					In China, as short video platforms such as Douyin entered the public’s field of vision, “雲養寵”,
					referring to “Cyber Pet Petting” in English, as a brand new type of video content, has begun to
					spread rapidly. Those who are not pet owners but enjoy consuming pet content found this as another
					way to compensate for the regret of not having a pet. In the past three years, the “Cyber Pet
					Petting Index” has increased by 10 times, according to Guojin Securities Research Center. Therefore,
					a number of pet vloggers emerged, relying upon their advertising income to earn a living and become
					wealthy.
				</h3>
				<h3>Mr. Yan Gaoqi’s first Shiba Inu, named Kiwi, came to his home two years ago. At that point he
					decided
					to record everything about Kiwi’s growth. Since then he has been filming Kiwi with his phone and
					posting the videos on Weibo and Douyin, which marked the beginning of his career as a pet vlogger.

					<h3>Although now his account possesses over 330,000 followers on Sina Weibo and a similar number of
						followers on Douyin, at the early stage he faced difficulty in growing his fan base.
						“I was good at taking appealing images of my dogs,” he said, “but as time went by, the audience
						had aesthetics weariness and became more demanding on my photos.”
					</h3>
					<h3>After studying those most popular pet vlogs, he found that people easily related to the videos
						showing authentic and ordinary life. Thereafter, he embraced the trend and started to create
						funny videos. “It is an age when people are attached to contagious videos which bring about
						easiness,” he admitted.
					</h3>
					<h3>Nowadays, there are a variety of formats of “Cyber Pet Petting”, among which short videos within
						five minutes is the most popular type. No matter if the users keep a pet or not, around 50% of
						them would like to watch this format of pet videos to fulfil themselves. Other formats such as
						long videos (more than five minutes), Gif photos and static photos also attract around 30% of
						the two groups of users for each.

					<h3>The short videos going viral on social media often follow certain patterns. Those pet vlogs
						which caters to the desire of people who do not have pets yet get hits more easily. They become
						the emotional outlets of those people and help to relieve their loneliness. In other words,
						people got a sense of healing in the middle of their busy life by watching pets’ fun and
						relaxing interaction.
					</h3>
					<h2>Mr. Yan said, “Lots of people told me that after watching my pet vlogs, they feel themselves
						healed.”
					</h2>
					<h3>On the road to becoming a We Media blogger, content creators usually cannot totally rest upon
						themselves. After the career as a We Media blogger progressively took off, Mr. Yan signed a
						contract with the Louis Group, one of the earliest MCN agencies incubating KOLs (Key Opinion
						Leader) on Sina Weibo. The agency would collaborate closely with social media platforms, take
						charge of content distribution among various platforms, and represent signed bloggers to align
						with advertising clients. When it comes to the benefits, MCN provides considerable platform
						resources for its content creators, helping promote their expansion by means of “Fans Headlines”
						and so on.
					</h3>
					<h3>However, in the meantime, MCN would get most of the revenue. The income of most pet vloggers is
						mainly divided into two parts. One is to sign a contract with the platform that publishes the
						video and accept the remuneration paid by the platform on a regular basis, and the other is the
						income from commercial advertising. The price of one commercial video varies depending on the
						number of the pet vlogger’s followers. It is reported that for “Small Vest for Memory
						Recalling”, one of the most popular pet vloggers on Weibo with over 20 million followers, the
						price is more than 100 thousand RMB.
					</h3>
					<h3>In Mr. Yan’s case, he and his MCN agreed on an equal income split. The quoted price for him to
						produce each advertising video amounts to 7,000 RMB. He mentioned that although the social media
						platforms would provide incentives for vloggers, the amount is far from enough to cover their
						daily expenses. Moreover, the advertising income is not steady enough. Therefore, most pet
						vloggers cannot earn their living fully upon their career as vloggers.
					</h3>
					<h2>“Compared with other industries such as the beauty industry, our income ceiling is restricted by
						the budget control of brand merchants,” he admitted.
					</h2>

					<h3>From the perspective of e-commerce merchants, the arrival of short videos has actually opened up
						the barriers between pet owners and the pet industry. People can interact with their favorite
						pets through watching pet vlogs incorporated with some commercial advertising content. This, to
						a certain extent, has connected potential consumers with merchants in the pet industry,
						directing more traffic to their products and services.
					</h3>
					<h3>However, there are limitations in terms of whether the audience really trusts advertising
						content in pet vlogs.
					</h3>
					<h2>Zhou, a student at Hong Kong Baptist University, said, “I usually would
						not believe in the products mentioned by pet vloggers in their promotion videos.”
					</h2>
					<h3>This suggests that there is a bottleneck in constructing a full-scale industry supply chain and
						ecosystem, starting from pet vlogs and ending up with purchasing pet products and services from
						e-commerce merchants.</h3>
